# Text Analysis with Python

## Overview
This demonstrates core text analysis techniques using Python and the NLTK library. 
It performs sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency analysis on a text file.

## Features
- File-based text processing
- Sentence tokenization (with and without NLTK)
- Word tokenization (sentence-wise)
- Total and unique word counting
- Text normalization using lowercasing
- Stopword removal
- Word frequency distribution
- Reusable text analysis function

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
